Raster Vision allows engineers to quickly and repeatably configure **pipelines** that go through core components of a machine learning workflow: analyzing training data, creating training chips, training models, creating predictions, evaluating models, and bundling the model files and configuration for easy deployment.

The input to a Raster Vision pipeline is a set of images and training data, optionally with Areas of Interest (AOIs) that describe where the images are labeled. The output of a Raster Vision pipeline is a model bundle that allows you to easily utilize models in various deployment scenarios.

The pipelines include running the following commands:

* **ANALYZE**: Gather dataset-level statistics and metrics for use in downstream processes.
* **CHIP**: Create training chips from a variety of image and label sources.
* **TRAIN**: Train a model using a "backend" such as PyTorch.
* **PREDICT**: Make predictions using trained models on validation and test data.
* **EVAL**: Derive evaluation metrics such as F1 score, precision and recall against the model's predictions on validation datasets.
* **BUNDLE**: Bundle the trained model and associated configuration into a :ref:`model bundle <model bundle>`, which can be deployed in batch processes, live servers, and other workflows.

Pipelines are configured using a compositional, programmatic approach that makes configuration easy to read, reuse, and maintain. Below, we show the ``tiny_spacenet`` example.

.. literalinclude:: /../rastervision_pytorch_backend/rastervision/pytorch_backend/examples/tiny_spacenet.py
    :language: python
    :caption: tiny_spacenet.py
    :lines: 3-

Raster Vision uses a ``unittest``-like method for executing pipelines. For instance, if the above was defined in `tiny_spacenet.py`, with the proper setup you could run the experiment on AWS Batch by running:

.. code:: shell

    > rastervision run batch tiny_spacenet.py

See the :ref:`quickstart` for a more complete description of using this example.
